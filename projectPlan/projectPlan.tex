	\title{Own Idea - Computer Science Forum - Project Plan}
	\author{Group No. 2 - Screw you Gary, we'll call it what we want.}
	\maketitle
	\section{Project goals and objectives}
		\subsection{Background}
			\par The project was our own idea to do, hence doesnâ€™t have the same context as other 
			projects. We are aiming to create an online forum for computer science students 
			of Trinity College Dublin to contribute to and benefit from, hence 
			we are treating our course-mates as our clients, and will ensure that they are happy with the final product. 

			\par Catering for computer science students, we will have to keep their various activities in mind, and
			 build a forum that suits their needs in regards to these activities. 
			For example, we need to be able to segment the forum into different 
			groupings based on year group, so that students can easily seek out 
			their peers. We also need to keep subject lists in mind, and 
			create sub-forums for each so that again students can seek out exactly what they need as soon as possible.
		\subsection{Objectives}
			\par Successful completion of the project should lead to increased communication amongst computer 
			science students, and hopefully an increased understanding of their course, 
			assignments and subject matter. The hope is that students will use the forum 
			to aid each other and contribute to meaningful discussions about their real world studies.

		\subsection{Goals}
			\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
				\item A specialised online message board for computer science students of Trinity College Dublin to contribute questions, answers and discussions about their course.
				\item Separated sub-forums per year grouping, which is further broken down into sub-forums for each topic and module.
				\item Unique information for each user and post. For example, unique user names, unique post dates, etc.
				\item Moderator tools to maintain the forum, help prevent spam and edit currently existing posts.
				\item Best Response System, where the original poster of a topic can highlight a response that they thought 
				was best/gained the most knowledge from so that other users in a similar position can easily get the same benefits.
			\end{enumerate}
